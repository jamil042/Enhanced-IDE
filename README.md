# Enhanched IDE

Welcome to the Custom IDE project! This project is designed to provide a customizable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with enhanced features. Below are the steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- JavaFX SDK
- An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Getting Started

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
  npm run test
```

#### Step 2: Create a New Project in Your IDE

Open your preferred IDE and create a new project. Make sure to set up the project with the appropriate JDK version.


#### Step 3: Open the Repository Files in Your Project

Import the cloned repository files into your new project. Ensure all files are correctly placed in the project structure.


#### Step 4: Add JAR Files to Your JavaFX Library

Add the following JAR files to your project's library:
- antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar
- richtextfx-fat-0.11.4.jar

These libraries are essential for the project's functionality.


#### Step 5: Edit Configuration for the Project

Configure your project to include the JavaFX SDK and the added JAR files. Set up the run configuration to point to the CustomIDE.java file as the main class.

#### Step 6: Run the Program

Once everything is set up, run the CustomIDE.java file to start the Custom IDE.
